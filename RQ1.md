# How has the average price for a meal in Schleswig-Holstein changed since 2021? 

## Exploring Meal Price Changes in Schleswig-Holstein Since 2021

To explore this research question we build a data set for all canteens in Schleswig-Holstein. This data set dates back to 2021 and is merged from the OpenMensa API and web scraped data. Since 2021, the dynamics of meal pricing within Schleswig-Holstein's canteens have undergone noticeable changes. Here we analyse different aspects: geographical (by city), status-based (student, employee, guest), and dietary categories (vegan, vegetarian, omnivorous). We aim to unravel the intricacies of these pricing adjustments.

### Price Over Time by City

Looking at the average meal pricing data of the cities it reveals that each city within Schleswig-Holstein exhibited significant price changes. Kiel, Flensburg, and Heide have shown a steady increase in meal prices. Lübeck presents an interesting case with the smallest price increase by EUR, but only an slightly smaller percentage increase than the rest, indicating that the local pricing in general seems to be cheaper.

| **Schleswig-Holstein:** | 0.36 €              | 9.87 \%                       |

In 2022 and 2023, meal prices in Schleswig-Holstein (SH) rose significantly, yet remained below the German food inflation rate. There are some interesting aspects about each city, such as the big differences of both years in Flensburg and Lübeck. However, we can see an overall increasing trend in both years.

| Location          | 2022   | 2023  |
|-------------------|-------|-------|
| Kiel:             | 8.7 %  | 12.4 % |
| Flensburg:        | 1.7 %  | 9.8 %  |
| Lübeck:           | 15.8 % | 6.8 %  |
| Heide:            | 11.8 % | 12.2 % |
| **SH:**           | 9.5 %  | 10.3 % |
